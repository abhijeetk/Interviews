 1.  Write an iterator class for finding the inorder successor in a Binary Tree
 2. Given a MxN matrix return the count of islands

>     0 0 1 1 0 1
>     0 0 1 1 1 0
>     1 1 0 0 0 0


Ex: 3 islands in the above matrix (an island has all 1s in the neighboring nodes, not diagonally)

3. Chrome is implementing remote desktop feature where a user can log into another maching through an app installed from Chrome and do remote desktop operations. Test plan for this feature. Had to cover everything - app, RDP (media negotiation), sender side, receiver side etc

4. Given a sorted list of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval at the right location if it does not overlap. If it does, return the merged interval.
>  [3,10] [5,20] [6,40] 
>  If [4,25] --> return [3,10] [5,25] [6,40]
>  If [1,2] --> return [1,2] [3,10] [5,20] [6,40]

5. Test plan for formatting feature in Google doc (online)

6. Given a sentence reverse the order of words

> Input : I am Vivek
> Output : Vivek am I

7. Assume Google is implementing push to update OS on Android phones. Design a test plan to test this.
